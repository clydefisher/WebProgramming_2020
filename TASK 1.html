        <h2> Hello fellow commrade,</h2>
        <P> Now, this is a story all about how
            My life got flipped-turned upside down
            And I'd like to take a minute
            Just sit right there
            I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
            In west Philadelphia born and raised
            On the playground was where I spent most of my days
            Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
            And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
            When a couple of guys who were up to no good
            Started making trouble in my neighborhood
            I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
            She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
            I begged and pleaded with her day after day
            But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
            She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
            I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.â€¦
        </P>
